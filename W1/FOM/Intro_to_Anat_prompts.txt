Check For Understanding 1 Prompt:

**Based on the learning objective:**
{
Identify major parts of the body.
}

**Content:**

Anatomy I. Anatomy is the setting in which bodily processes take place 6 Theater set of a clinical setting Set of Hamilton Set of Elf Theater set in a doctor’s office
The setting influences your expectations “Does this belong here?” 7 Anatomy I. Gross Anatomy • Study of structures visible to the naked eye • From the greek “anatome” meaning to cut
or take apart • Dissection labs • Surgery, clinical imaging Histology • Study of the microscopic architecture of cells in a tissue • Virtual microscope labs • Clinical pathology

and makes up a large part of medical terminology” Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e - Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e II.
9 Naming of Anatomical Structures II. • Descriptive terms - ex: longissimus is a very long muscle of the back • Relative body position - ex: cervical; latin
for “neck” • According to function - ex: erector spinae muscles function to straighten (erect) the vertebral column (spine) • Named after a real or mythological figure - ex: Achilles tendon)
http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/announcements/vesalius.html Etching from De Humani Corporis Fabrica 10 II.A. Regional Anatomy Major parts of the body:
• Head • Neck • Upper Limb • Thorax • Back • Abdomen • Pelvis/Perineum • Lower Limb Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e
11 II.B. Anatomical Position Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e Anatomical position • Standing up straight or laying down as if standing
• Feet slightly apart • Head facing forward • Palms facing front of body (supinated) All locations and movements in anatomy are
named relative to anatomical position 12 Planes of Reference II.C. Figure 1.2. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e Sagittal plane – vertical plane, divides body into left and right
Coronal (frontal) plane – vertical plane, divides body into front and back Transverse (horizontal) plane – horizontal plane, divides body
into top and bottom Sagittal Plane Coronal Plane Transverse Plane (midsagittal plane) Computer Tomography (CT) scan in the horizontal plane
13 Directional Terms Superior – toward the head (top of the body) Inferior – toward the feet (bottom of the body)
Anterior (ventral) – toward belly side (front of the body) Posterior (dorsal) – toward the back of the body II.D. Directional terms occur in pairs of opposites Image adapted from: https://termandhistology.wordpress.com/anatomy-language/anatomical-positions-planes-directions/
Anterior (ventral) Posterior (dorsal) Superior Inferior

**Task**
Your task is to create 5 more Third-order questions that require applying knowledge to clinical scenarios, often involving multiple steps to identify the correct answer. For example, a question might present a patient case and ask you to determine the likely deficits or complications based on the information
