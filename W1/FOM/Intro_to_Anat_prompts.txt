Anatomy I. Anatomy is the setting in which bodily processes take place 6 Theater set of a clinical setting Set of Hamilton Set of Elf Theater set in a doctor’s office
The setting influences your expectations “Does this belong here?” 7 Anatomy I. Gross Anatomy • Study of structures visible to the naked eye • From the greek “anatome” meaning to cut
or take apart • Dissection labs • Surgery, clinical imaging Histology • Study of the microscopic architecture of cells in a tissue • Virtual microscope labs • Clinical pathology

and makes up a large part of medical terminology” Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e - Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e II.
9 Naming of Anatomical Structures II. • Descriptive terms - ex: longissimus is a very long muscle of the back • Relative body position - ex: cervical; latin
for “neck” • According to function - ex: erector spinae muscles function to straighten (erect) the vertebral column (spine) • Named after a real or mythological figure - ex: Achilles tendon)
http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/announcements/vesalius.html Etching from De Humani Corporis Fabrica 10 II.A. Regional Anatomy Major parts of the body:
• Head • Neck • Upper Limb • Thorax • Back • Abdomen • Pelvis/Perineum • Lower Limb Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e
11 II.B. Anatomical Position Figure 1.1. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e Anatomical position • Standing up straight or laying down as if standing
• Feet slightly apart • Head facing forward • Palms facing front of body (supinated) All locations and movements in anatomy are
named relative to anatomical position 12 Planes of Reference II.C. Figure 1.2. Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 8e Sagittal plane – vertical plane, divides body into left and right
Coronal (frontal) plane – vertical plane, divides body into front and back Transverse (horizontal) plane – horizontal plane, divides body
into top and bottom Sagittal Plane Coronal Plane Transverse Plane (midsagittal plane) Computer Tomography (CT) scan in the horizontal plane
13 Directional Terms Superior – toward the head (top of the body) Inferior – toward the feet (bottom of the body)
Anterior (ventral) – toward belly side (front of the body) Posterior (dorsal) – toward the back of the body II.D. Directional terms occur in pairs of opposites Image adapted from: https://termandhistology.wordpress.com/anatomy-language/anatomical-positions-planes-directions/


Anterior (ventral) Posterior (dorsal) Superior Inferior

**Task**
Your task is to create 5 more Third-order questions that require applying knowledge to clinical scenarios, often involving multiple steps to identify the correct answer. For example, a question might present a patient case and ask you to determine the likely deficits or complications based on the information

Based on the learning objectives:
{
List the overall goal and general components of each body system.
Describe how muscles act on bones to produce movement.
}

Classification of Bones
Long bone
(humerus)
Flat bone
(sternum)
Short bone
(talus)
Irregular bone
(vertebra)
Classified by Shape:
• Long bones – elongated shape, most common in limbs
• Short bones – bones of wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals)
• Flat bones – typically have a protective function
• Irregular bones – various shapes
• Sesamoid bone – short bone embedded in tendon (ex: patella)
Bones have markings which are evidence of attachment points for
muscles or tendons, or grooves where neurovasculature travels

Articulations
Articulations (joints) are the site of joining of
two bones, often held together by ligaments
All muscles crossing a particular joint produce
movement at that joint.

Skeletal Muscle
https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/1919-muscle-types
*For each muscle you learn, you will need to know the
action of the muscle and the nerve that innervates it!
III.A.
Skeletal muscle functions to produce voluntary movement
Muscles attach to bones via tendons
• Tendon – connects muscle to bone
• Ligament – connects bone to bone
• Aponeurosis – broad, flat tendon
The action of a muscle depends on its attachment points:
• Origin – fixed attachment point of a muscle
• Insertion – attachment of muscle that moves with
muscle contraction
• Action – movement resulting from contraction of a
muscle
26© Palm Beach State College
Muscle Actions
A muscle has an action at each joint it crosses
Muscle contraction leads to shortening of the
muscle to pull on bones
Muscles work in groups:
• Agonist – primary mover of an action
• Synergist – muscle working with agonist to
produce a movement
• Antagonist – muscle working in opposition
of the agonist
Agonist (prime mover)
For flexion at the elbow
Antagonist
For flexion at
the elbow
Synergist
For flexion at the elbow
Insertion
of brachioradialis

Origin

Musculoskeletal System
Bones are important for support, protection, mineral storage, and
blood cell production
• Axial vs appendicular skeleton
• Classification of bones by shape
Articulations (joints) are the site of joining of two bones, often held
together by ligaments
Skeletal muscles function to produce voluntary movement
Muscle contraction leads to shortening of the muscle to pull on bones
• Agonist – primary mover of an action
• Synergist – muscle working with agonist to produce a movement
• Antagonist – muscle working in opposition of the agonist

muscle and the nerve that innervates it!

Terms of Movement
*Terms of movement also occur in pairs of opposites*
Flexion
• Decreasing the angle between bones at a joint
(ex: bending leg at the knee)
• Moved in an anterior direction (ex: bending torso forward)
Extension
• Increasing the angle between bones at a joint
(ex: straightening knee)
• Moved in a posterior direction (ex: leaning torso back)

Terms of Movement
• Abduction – move away from the midline
• Adduction – move toward the midline
• Medial rotation – movement of the
anterior surface toward the median
• Lateral rotation – movement of the
anterior surface away from the median
• Circumduction – movement combining
flexion / extension and abduction /
adduction
